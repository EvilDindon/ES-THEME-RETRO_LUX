  # ** IMPORTANT SCRAPING INSTRUCTIONS **

This theme relies on clean artwork.
I recommand SCRAPING all your games using SCREENSCRAPER with the following parameters :

# IMAGE SOURCE : SCREENSHOT

# BOX SOURCE : BOX 2D

# LOGO SOURCE : WHEEL

# SCRAP FANART : YES

These 3 parameters are mandatory. If you put other thing (mix images, etc.) the theme will not look as good as intended.
